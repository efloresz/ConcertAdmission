# ConcertAdmission
* This program determines if a user is granted concert admissions based on data input validation. 
* The program calculates the ticket price based on the number of tickets purchased. 

# What I Learned:
* Loop Conditionals
* Data Validation and Calculations 
* User Input and Output
## Sample outputs:
