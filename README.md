## What I Learned:
- Loop Conditionals
- Data Validation and Calculations
- User Input and Output

### Sample outputs:
![Greater than 3 tickets purchased](https://github.com/efloresz/ConcertAdmission/assets/110843762/e99a940c-8c0f-4473-af01-cab8d8f53cfe)

![Less than 3 tickets purchased](https://github.com/efloresz/ConcertAdmission/assets/110843762/3e7a300e-d60c-4159-a7ae-e547d3f16723)

![User does not meet requirements](https://github.com/efloresz/ConcertAdmission/assets/110843762/b508a95c-8c79-4909-a030-c9f01942e3dc)
